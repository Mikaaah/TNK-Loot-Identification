# Configuration

Edit `config/tnkloot/tiers.json` on the server. A copy of the defaults is in [the example file](https://github.com/Mikaaah/TNK-Loot-Identification/blob/main/examples/tiers.example.json). `/tnkloot reload` applies edits without restarting. Invalid settings reject the **whole reload** and retain the last good in-memory settings; the edited file is left untouched. On a first launch with invalid config and no previous good settings, identification stays disabled until corrected.

## Global keys

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `progression_mode` | `ADVANCEMENTS` | `ADVANCEMENTS`, `FTB_QUESTS`, `MANUAL` or `OFF` |
| `share_ftb_teams` | `true` | Read and grant the current optional FTB team's shared rank |
| `identification_enabled` | `true` | Allow item redemption |
| `handheld_identification` | `false` | Legacy compatibility key; handheld identification is removed |
| `station_identification` | `true` | Allow redemption at the Identifier block |
| `replace_weapon_loot` | `true` | Replace configured item stacks in generated loot with category-specific tokens |
| `identification_costs` | Object | Configure currency and prices |
| `tiers` | Required array | Tier definitions; rank 0 required |
| `weapons` | Required array | Weighted equipment entries (name retained for config compatibility) |

Unknown keys are rejected to catch misspellings. Booleans must be JSON booleans; ranks/weights must be whole numbers within Java's integer range.

## Tiers

```json
{"rank": 3, "id": "explorer", "name": "Explorer", "advancements": ["minecraft:story/mine_diamond"], "apotheosis_rarity": "apotheosis:epic"}
```

Ranks must be unique, nonnegative and below 2147483647. They can have gaps. IDs must be unique, using letters, digits and underscores; they normalize to lowercase. `name` defaults to the ID. `advancements` is optional; **any** listed completed advancement grants the tier in advancement mode. An empty list means no automatic grant. Unlocking a higher tier does not require earlier milestones. `apotheosis_rarity` is optional and defaults to this mod's Common → Uncommon → Rare → Epic → Legendary → Mythic → Ancient ladder according to rank. It selects the rarity used to generate native Apotheosis affixes when a token is identified. The mod supplies these seven rarities; their natural world-loot weights are zero, so they are awarded through this progression system. Map multiple Guild tiers to one rarity, or use your own datapack rarity ID.

## Equipment pools

```json
{"item": "examplemod:steel_sword", "category": "weapon", "min_tier": 2, "max_tier": 4, "weight": 5}
```

`min_tier` is required. `max_tier` is inclusive and defaults to 2147483647. `weight` defaults to 1 and must be positive. Weight is relative to other available eligible entries: weights 5 and 1 produce probabilities 5/6 and 1/6. Repeating the same item in overlapping entries adds its weights.

Categories are `weapon`, `bow`, `helmet`, `chestplate`, `leggings`, `boots`, `tool` and `accessory`. `category` defaults to `weapon` for older config files. A configured category needs at least one eligible item at every tier; unconfigured categories do not produce tokens. The item ID can belong to any installed mod. Missing mod items and `minecraft:air` are skipped at runtime. Run `/tnkloot validate` after loading to ensure those IDs also exist in this installation. An empty live pool refuses redemption and preserves the token.

A token's recorded rank is matched directly to these inclusive ranges, even if that rank is later removed from the config. Keep old ranges covered if you want existing tokens to remain usable. Loot results are fresh original item stacks, preserving the original mod item and its moveset integrations.

## Loot replacement and Apotheosis

`replace_weapon_loot` is on by default. The global loot modifier replaces every generated stack whose exact item ID is configured with one category-specific, tier-stamped token per item. For example, a configured `minecraft:wooden_sword` stack becomes `tnkloot:unidentified_weapon`; an iron helmet becomes `tnkloot:unidentified_helmet`. This applies to vanilla and modded entity, chest, boss and other loot tables without replacing unrelated drops. Loot generated with a player context snapshots that player's effective tier; context-free loot (usually structure chests) starts at rank 0. The result is then clamped to the configured item's tier range, so a chest containing an item with `min_tier: 3` grants a tier-3 token instead of a tier-0 one. Removing an item from the registry stops future conversions. Disable the option to preserve the original loot.

## Identification costs

```json
"identification_costs": {
  "enabled": true,
  "item": "minecraft:emerald",
  "default": 1,
  "per_tier": {"0": 1, "1": 2, "2": 3, "3": 5, "4": 8, "5": 12, "6": 18, "7": 25},
  "per_item": {"minecraft:netherite_sword": 32}
}
```

Costs are charged from the player's inventory and offhand. Per-item prices override per-tier prices, which override `default`. Set `enabled` to `false` for free identification. A token remains intact when the pool is empty or the player cannot pay. Each issued token stores its tier and a stable roll seed so retrying after a failed payment cannot reroll the selected base item.

## Identifier block

Craft or grant `tnkloot:identifier`. Place it to spawn a protected, stationary Guild Identifier behind the counter, facing the counter. Right-click either the block or attendant, insert up to seven tokens (one per slot), then confirm the total cost. Shift-click transfers tokens into the row. Each item cycles through every eligible base item before revealing its result, using note-block ticks and a final chime. A batch is prepared and paid for once; all inventory actions are locked while it rolls. Closing, disconnecting or dying returns the already-paid final results. Breaking the block removes the attendant with departure particles.

Operators can run `/tnkloot editor` in game to open the tier editor. Navigate configured ranks, cycle the Apotheosis rarity mapping, add or remove the held item from a tier, and create a new tier. Changes are validated and written to `config/tnkloot/tiers.json` immediately. The editor generates new IDs and names for tiers; edit `id`, `name`, or `advancements` in JSON and run `/tnkloot reload` for those fields.

Apotheosis is a required runtime dependency. Install Apotheosis 1.21.1-8.9.0 or newer together with its required mods: Placebo, Apothic Attributes, Apothic Spawners, Apothic Enchanting and Patchouli. For each tier, `apotheosis_rarity` must match a rarity registered by Apotheosis or a datapack. Identification applies Apotheosis' normal rarity rules and affixes to eligible selected items. A missing rarity, unsupported loot category or empty affix pool rejects the entire batch before payment and preserves all tokens. See [Apotheosis presets](https://github.com/Mikaaah/TNK-Loot-Identification/wiki/Apotheosis-Presets). Adding an accessory to a pool also requires an Apotheosis loot-category integration for that item.
