Turn equipment drops into unidentified finds, then reveal their potential at a **seven-slot Guild Identifier**. A configurable loot and progression mod for **Minecraft 1.21.1 / NeoForge**, built around real **Apotheosis affixes**.

## Find it. Identify it. Build around it.

- Unidentified **weapons, bows, armor, tools and accessories**, with tier-aware rewards.
- A Guild Identifier counter with a cost preview, batch confirmation and animated item reveals.
- Configurable equipment pools, prices and progression; original item behavior and movesets are retained.
- Eight default Guild tiers, with advancement, quest, manual or unrestricted progression.
- An operator editor for rarity mappings and item pools, plus optional FTB Quests and FTB Teams integration.

## Install

Install the mod on **client and server** with **Java 21**, **Minecraft 1.21.1** and **NeoForge 21.1.262 or newer**. **Apotheosis is required**, with Placebo, Patchouli, Apothic Attributes, Apothic Spawners and Apothic Enchanting. FTB Quests and FTB Teams are optional.

[Download a successful GitHub artifact](https://github.com/Mikaaah/TNK-Loot-Identification/actions/workflows/build.yml): open a successful run, then download its plain mod JAR from Artifacts.

## First steps

1. Launch once to generate `config/tnkloot/tiers.json`.
2. Place the **Identifier** from the T&K Loot creative tab, or use `/give @s tnkloot:identifier` as an operator.
3. Collect an unidentified item, insert it at the counter, review the price and confirm.
4. For tier-aware test rewards, use `/tnkloot unidentified @s explorer helmet`.

Modpacks can change equipment pools, identification costs, tier names and unlock milestones. Existing configuration files are preserved on update.
