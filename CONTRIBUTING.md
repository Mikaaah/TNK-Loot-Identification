# Contributing

Use Java 21 and the checked-in Gradle wrapper. Run `./gradlew build` before submitting changes. Include a short description of the behavior changed and how you checked it.

For bugs, include Minecraft/NeoForge/mod versions, reproduction steps, expected behavior, relevant logs and the edited `tiers.json`. Remove private paths or server addresses from logs. Test gameplay changes in a disposable world on both a client and dedicated server. Optional integrations must continue to load without FTB mods installed.

Keep saved tier ranks and the `tnkloot` item ID compatible unless the change includes a documented migration. Do not claim in-game or multiplayer validation based only on unit tests.

Build instructions and technical checks are in [the contributor reference](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
